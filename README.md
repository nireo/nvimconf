# neovim dotfiles

A pretty minimal neovim configuration that contains features for writing c++, go and python code. The config is written fully in lua. 


## Getting started 

```
git clone https://github.com/nireo/nvimconf ~/.config/nvim
```

This is the only command that you need to run. Just open neovim and lazy.nvim will install all packages for you and after that you're good to go.
