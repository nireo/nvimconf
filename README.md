# neovim dotfiles

A pretty minimal neovim configuration that doesn't have a lot of plugins. Mainly used for Go, Rust and C development. Also supports Zig and some js/ts. 


## Setup 

```
git clone https://github.com/nireo/nvimconf ~/.config/nvim
```

This is the only command that you need to run. Just open neovim and lazy.nvim will install all packages for you and after that you're good to go.
